When you have xcode installs you can open the simulator for iOS via terminal with:

```
open a- Simulator 
```

You cd in the directory that you want to create the app in

```
create wotd_app
```

Now you cd in the app and open the app (it will open in the simulator) 

```
flutter run
```

To stop it use 
```
ctrl + c
```

## To use an actual iOS device for testing 

sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
